# Hi, I'm Zachary

I build simple tools to solve my own problems — mostly terminal apps, mostly in Rust.

Minimalism is the goal. Not just in design, but in function. I prefer clarity, speed, and systems I can understand top to bottom.

- 🦀 Rust (preferred)
- 🐍 Python (when it makes sense)
- 🖥 Retro computing, FOSS, and elegant CLI tools
- 🏹 Archery, 📚 reading, and the occasional deep rabbit hole

## Projects

Most of what I build starts as a solution for myself. You'll find:

- Terminal-based companions for reading and note-taking  
- Scripts for system reporting and automation  
- Experiments with recursion, performance, and design
